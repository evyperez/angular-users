# Search GitHub Users

This web application is an example of how to make a request in API with pagination and sort.

You can search GitBub users by username, but GitHub only allows viewing of the first 1000 results and an error  should be displayed when this happens. GitHub also has I.P fetch limit, if this happens wait a few minutes and try again.

On results page, you can sort the results by login or type, in descending or ascending order.

You can see the aplication on [Netlify](https://glittering-lebkuchen-c5d15e.netlify.app/)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
